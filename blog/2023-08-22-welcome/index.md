Proctoring exams has become a crucial part of online education and assessment. With the rise of learning management systems (LMS), it’s easier than ever to create exams and administer them to students. However, many LMS solutions require the installation of third-party software for proctoring, which can be time-consuming and complicated.


Fortunately, it is possible to proctor exams created from LMS on WordPress without installing any third-party software! Here’s how you can do it.

1.   **Choose a WordPress LMS plugin that supports proctoring**: The first step is to choose an LMS plugin for WordPress that has built-in proctoring features. Some popular options include LearnDash, LifterLMS, and WP Courseware.
2.   **Create a secure exam**: Once you’ve chosen an LMS plugin, create a secure exam that you want to proctor. This should include setting up the questions, answer choices, and grading system.
3.   **Set up webcam monitoring**: This will ensure that students are not cheating by looking up answers or having someone else take the exam for them. Plugins such as WordPress Online Exam Proctoring for LMS leverage the AI based detection to detect multiple faces and can perform gaze detection as well.
4.   **Set up screen recording**: To further deter cheating, consider setting up screen recording during the exam. This will allow you to review the student’s activity during the exam and ensure that they are not opening other tabs or applications.
5. **Create a secure login process**: To prevent students from sharing their login information with others, consider using a secure login process. This could include a two-factor authentication system, IP tracking, or requiring students to provide a photo ID.
6. **Send out exam invitations**: Once the exam is set up and the proctoring features are in place, send out invitations to the students to take the exam. Make sure to include clear instructions on how to access the exam, how long they have to complete it, and any other important details.
7. **Monitor the exams**: During the exam, monitor the students through the webcam and screen recording features to ensure that they are following the rules and not cheating. This can be done WordPress Online Exam Proctoring for LMS which lets you monitor all the students taking the test at one place.
